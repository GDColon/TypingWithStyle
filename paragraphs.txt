I'll have two number 9's, a number 9 large, a number 6 with extra dip, a number 7, two number 45's, one with cheese, and a large soda.

They've got allen wrenches, gerbil feeders, toilet seats, electric heaters, trash compactors, juice extractor, shower rods and water meters.

The story so far: In the beginning the Universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.

Scheming, streaming, test your IQ! We've got a lobby waiting for you. Scheming, streaming, what do we do? Who's the impostor? Maybe it's you!

Hey all, Scott here! It IS laundry season - seems like everyone is cleaning their clothes these days. I'm not one to go against trends... I'll do it.

Hot food. We sit out to eat, and the potato's a bit hot. So I only put a little bit on my fork and I blow. Till it's cool, just cool, into the mouth, nice.

Sometimes I'm angry I'm not doing better than I thought I'd do at this point. I punish myself by depriving my health of the things that I like until I fix this.

I pledge allegiance to the sus of the United Crewmates of Amogus, and to the tasks for which it stands, one impostor, acting sus, with vents and sabotage for all.

This is the augmented Totino's(R) short paragraph. You have exactly 30 seconds to type and repost this or you will never be able to eat Totino's(R) products again.

And hear me out on this one, bear with me here. And then he turned himself into a pickle. Which I tell you, buddy, is the funniest thing I have ever seen in my life.

Hi. You're on a rock floating in space. Pretty cool, huh? Some of it's water. Actually, most of it's water. I can't even get from here to there without buying a boat.

I yearn for true gender equality. I have no patience for one who talks about female privilege when it suits them, and then complains about "not being a man" when it's convenient.

I, EvaX, humbly submit a toast to Nicholas Alexander for successfully managing to pirate Warcraft III, so that he may play Defense of The Ancients. Congratulations, Nick. Enjoy your DOTA.

You're familliar with Billy Mitchell? World video game champion? He could probably do it, so I gotta find a way to harness his power. And I think I found a way! That's right, we're gonna cheat.





We're gonna talk about e! The big, famous constant, e. It's one of the famous mathematical constants, one of the most important, goes along with pi, and I don't know, golden ratio, and square root of two.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head.

These bridges are made from natural light that I pump in from the surface. If you rubbed your cheek on one, it would be like standing outside with the sun shining on your face. It would also set your hair on fire, so don't actually do it.

According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyways. Because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.

Did you know that in terms of male human and female Pokemon breeding, Vaporeon is the most compatible Pokemon for humans? Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3 feet tall and 63.9 pounds.

I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system.

The FitnessGram Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal.

Here's our first incredible revelation: There's no such place as Wyoming. Think about it - have you ever met anyone from Wyoming? ...Well, there you are. The myth of Wyoming began in the year 1789 when the great explorer and mapmaker Arbuckle Vespucci was designing the United States.

I have gotten the COVID vaccine about 20 times now. 4 Pfizer, 12 Moderna, 4 Johnson. Once I got my first vaccine, I started craving for it. There is something so great knowing I am reducing the spread of the Coronavirus with each of them. I am feeling so empowered. I think I may be addicted. At least it won't kill me!

Abstract: The exponential dependence of resistivity on temperature in germanium is found to be a great big lie. My careful theoretical modeling and painstaking experimentation reveal 1) that my equipment is crap, as are all the available texts on the subject and 2) that this whole exercise was a complete waste of my time.

Can't you understand, I'm an old man, bones are brittle but I shake when I can! I take out my teeth before I eat candy, fine like wine but granny looks dandy! Reek like a mothball, willing and able, checkin' out my lady at the bingo table! Lookin' so fine and now I'm gettin' ready, I don't need diapers, I don't rocksteady!

Art. Art! What IS art? Is it wearing a beret? Is it using big words to seem deep? Is this goose art? More importantly, when is art? And when is dinner? And where are my pants? And where am I? And have you seen my mom? I'm lost and confused, please help me. All of these questions and more, on the next episode of In The Quarantine.

In December 2016, President Max Profitt Haltmann passed a bill making Chip mashups illegal. However, in early 2018, doctors found a medicinal usage for Chip mashups, with one mashup having the same effect as four doses of Ripedine. So please, consider signing Proposition 72 to have Chip mashups legalized. Paid for by the Rapper's Union.



200+ WPM will never happen. It's literally impossible. A lie, a myth, a farce propagated by the government to mislead the ignorant. Anyone who thinks that it's possible is stupid and should feel ashamed, and can wallow in their own lack of intelligence. This is an irreversible fact of speed typing and simply cannot be challenged. Go cry about it, nerds.

Oh, Minecrap! I cannot wait to play Minecrap. Do you know what my favorite thing to do is in Minecrap? I love building bricks with Minecrap. Building bricks with Minecrap is the best thing and the most amount of fun you can have while playing an app. I understand why all the kids are playing this game these days -- it's because they like to build brown bricks with Minecrap.

Stanley stepped into the broom closet, but there was nothing here, so he turned around and got back on track. There was nothing here. No choice to make, no path to follow, just an empty broom closet. No reason to still be here. It was baffling that Stanley was still just sitting in the broom closet. He wasn't even doing anything, At least if there were something to interact with, he'd be justified in some way.

There are allegedly around 6.5 million Finns, right? That's out of seven billion humans. That means Finns make up 0.0912% of the planet. To put it another way, 99.9% of the planet are not Finns. How do we know this? Government censuses. Now, the best government censuses have a margin of error of at least 1%. So Finns make up 0.0912% of the planet, plus or minus one percent In conclusion: there is a 50/50 chance Finland doesn't exist.

No, you're NOT a real gamer. I'm so sick of all these people that think they're gamers. No, you're not. Most of you are not even close to being gamers. I see these people saying "I put well over 100 hours in this game, it's great!" That's nothing - most of us can easily put 300+ hours in all our games. I see people who only have a Nintendo Switch and claim to be gamers. Come talk to me when you pick up a PS4 controller, then we be friends.

Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life. He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.

These are universal proportions. I've studied the pipe strip, and analyzed Jon and Garfield's proportions against several universal mathematical constants. E, Pi, the Golden Ratio, and so on... and it's surprising... scary even, how things align. You can take tiny pieces of the pipe strip, for instance, take Jon's elbow from the second panel, and project it back over Jon's entire shape in the second panel, and you'll see a near perfect Fibonacci sequence emerge.

Water. Earth. Fire. Air. Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them, but when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years passed and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar, an airbender named Aang. And although his airbending skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone. But I believe Aang can save the world.

I have been ordered to issue an apology by the court of law. In no instance should childbirth be linked to illegal gambling. And if there's one thing that makes childbirth a drag, it's illegal gambling. Please forgive me and don't set up a child birth-off on your own. I must now stay at least 50 feet away from any pregnant women and must complete 14 minutes of community service by informing the public on a much less problematic topic: game console births and the titles that come with them.

A spectre is haunting Europe - the spectre of communism. All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre: Pope and Tsar, Metternich and Guizot, French Radicals and German police-spies. Where is the party in opposition that has not been decried as communistic by its opponents inpower? Where is the opposition that has not hurled back the branding reproach of communism, against the more advanced opposition parties, as well as against its reactionary adversaries?

I have made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgement, and I don't expect to be forgiven. I'm simply here to apologize. What we came across that day in the woods was obviously unplanned. The reactions you saw on tape were raw; they were unfiltered. None of us knew how to react or how to feel. I should have put the cameras down and stopped recording what we were going through. There's a lot of things I should have done differently but I didn't. And for that, from the bottom of my heart, I am sorry.
